what feature of device can be obtain by code in android
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👍 — in Android, your code can access a wide range of device features through system APIs (with user permissions where required).
Here’s a breakdown of what you can obtain or use:

📍 Location & Motion

GPS / Network Location → latitude, longitude, altitude, speed.

Cell Tower & Wi-Fi info → for location triangulation.

Step Counter & Motion Sensors → detect walking, running, sitting.

Accelerometer / Gyroscope → movement, shake detection, orientation.

Magnetometer (Compass) → direction (N/S/E/W).

Barometer → altitude / air pressure.

📞 Communication & Network

SIM card info (carrier, country, operator name).

IMEI / Device ID (restricted in newer Android versions).

Phone number (if available on SIM, often restricted).

Call logs & SMS (requires dangerous permissions, limited on Android 10+).

Contacts list (requires permission).

Network status → Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, Bluetooth on/off.

Hotspot/Tethering control (limited APIs).

🎥 Media & Camera

Camera access → take photo, record video, scan QR/barcodes.

Microphone → record audio, voice commands.

Gallery & Media Store → access images, videos, audio.

Screen Recording / Screenshot (needs special API + user consent).

🔋 Device State

Battery level & charging state.

Power source → charging via USB, AC, wireless.

Storage info → free/used memory, external SD card.

RAM usage & performance stats.

CPU temperature & usage (via system APIs or root in some cases).

🔒 Security & Identity

Biometrics → fingerprint, face, iris authentication.

Device lock status (screen locked/unlocked).

Keystore → for secure data storage.

Installed apps list (restricted on Android 11+).

Permissions status → check if user granted/denied.

📱 Hardware & System

Device model, manufacturer, OS version.

Screen resolution, DPI, orientation.

Audio state → volume level, silent/vibrate mode.

Vibration control (haptic feedback).

Flashlight control.

USB connection status.

🌐 Sensors / External

Bluetooth devices nearby (paired & scanned).

NFC → read/write NFC tags.

Fingerprint sensor hardware availability.

Proximity sensor (near/far detection, e.g., during calls).

Light sensor (ambient brightness).

⚡ Advanced (with restrictions / special permissions)

Accessibility Services → read screen content (useful for parental control).

Usage Stats → which apps were used, and for how long.

Background Services → monitor location, geofence alerts.

Device Admin / MDM APIs → lock device, wipe data (enterprise apps).

JobScheduler / WorkManager → background task scheduling.

👉 In short, with permissions + APIs, you can read or control almost every part of the device — though modern Android (10–14) restricts sensitive features like call logs, SMS, IMEI, and background tracking for privacy reasons.

Would you like me to make a table (feature → required permission → Android version limits) so you can directly map what you can/can’t use in your kids tracking app?
